# Manage-Landing-Page
A great Front End Mentor Challenge that tought me a lot about layouts. I mostly used SCSS for styling. Slider was especially hard to make for every screen size. In the design file slider's exact design for so many screen was missing. But in my solution both mobile screen (375px) and desktop screen (1440px) works perfectly as you can tell by the screenshots.
Also, I added a client side form validation. You can access the form by clicking "Get Started" button on navbar or hero.
